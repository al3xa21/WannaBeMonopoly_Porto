In this repository is the code for our version of the Monopoly board game.
This Monopoly has the city of Porto as its theme.

Note:

To avoid mistakes you should have the latest java version installed.
 
-> Running the code in IDE:
To play the game you must run the server first and choose the number of players.
Then for each player you should run a client.java.
Watch out: you cannot have sub-folders. If that happens the resource images will not load!

-> Execute .jar:
To play the game you must run the server.jar first.
Then you can run as many client.jar, for clients/players, as the server can hold (Up to 4 players).

The executable files can be found on the Wiki -> Executables
